Model S, engineered from the ground as an EV, is meticulously designed for superior aerodynamics, stability and handling, crash safety, performance and range. Before Model S enters production it will have been thoroughly tested using both computer simulations and test vehicles. Tesla will complete two vehicle testing phases, Alpha and Beta. The Alpha phase began in 2010.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Tesla FSD Beta continues to prove its reliability. The newest technology allowed a Tesla car to independently make an unprotected turn in downtown San Francisco with obstruction from a truck, which would have caused difficulty even for an experienced driver.

There is a lot of controversies when it comes to Tesla's FSD Beta technology. On the one hand, this is a new technology that has not yet been fully developed and must go through deep and extensive testing by responsible drivers. On the other hand, this is the technology of the future, which will ultimately allow cars to be fully autonomous, and do not require a human driver to drive. Be that as it may, this issue will cause controversy for a long time to come. However, the facts and real-life experience of drivers with FSD Beta can help clarify concerns.
